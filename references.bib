@article{Nedela1996,
	abstract = {According to M. Gardner ["Mathematical Games: Snarks, Boojums, and Other Conjectures Related to the Four-Color-Map Theorem," Scientific American, vol. 234 (1976), pp. 126-130], a snark is a nontrivial cubic graph whose edges cannot be properly colored by three colors. The problem of what "nontrivial" means is implicitly or explicitly present in most papers on snarks, and is the main motivation of the present paper. Our approach to the discussion is based on the following observation. If G is a snark with a k-edge-cut producing components G1 and G2, then either one of G1 and G2 is not 3-edge-colorable or by adding a "small" number of vertices to either component one can obtain snarks G̃1 and G̃2 whose order does not exceed that of G. The two situations lead to a definition of a k-reduction and k-decomposition of G. Snarks that for m < k do not admit m-reductions, m-decompositions, or both are k-irreducible, k-indecomposable, and k-simple, respectively. The irreducibility, indecomposability, and simplicity provide natural measures of nontriviality of snarks closely related to cyclic connectivity. The present paper is devoted to a detailed investigation of these invariants. The results give a complete characterization of irreducible snarks and characterizations of k-simple snarks for k ≤ 6. A number of problems that have arisen in this research conclude the paper. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

@article{MorphologyOfSmall,
	abstract = {This paper classifies all snarks up to order 36 and explains the reasons for their uncolourability. The crucial part of our approach is a computer-assisted structural analysis of cyclically 5-connected critical snarks, which is justified by the fact that every other snark can be constructed from them by a series of simple operations while preserving uncolourability. Our results reveal that most of the analysed snarks are built from pieces of the Petersen graph and can be naturally distributed into a small number of classes having the same reason for uncolourability. This sheds new light on the structure of all small snarks. Based on our analysis, we generalise certain individual snarks to infinite families and identify a rich family of cyclically 5-connected critical snarks.},

@article{Descartes1948,
	abstract = { I wonder why problems about map-colourings are so fascinating? I know several people who have made more or less serious attempts to prove the Four-Colour Theorem, and I suppose many more have made collections of maps in the hope of hitting upon a counter-example. I like P. G. Tait’s approach myself; he removed the problem from the plane so that it could be discussed in terms of more general figures. He showed that the Four-Colour Theorem is equivalent to the proposition that if N is a connected cubical network, without an isthmus, in the plane, then the edges of N can be coloured in three colours so that the colours of the three meeting at any vertex are all different. (A cubical network is a set of points called vertices joined in pairs by simple arcs called edges, no two of which intersect except at a common vertex, in such a way that just three edges meet at each vertex. An isthmus is an edge whose removal destroys the connection of the network.) It was at first conjectured that every cubical network having no isthmus could be “three-coloured” in this way, but this was disproved by the example of Fig. 1, for which it may readily be verified that no three-colouring exists. },

@article{ChladnyFactorisation,
	abstract = {We develop a theory of factorisation of snarks-cubic graphs with edge-chroma- tic number 4 - based on the classical concept of the dot product. Our main concern are irreducible snarks, those where the removal of every nontrivial edge-cut yields a 3-edge colourable graph. We show that if an irreducible snark can be expressed as a dot product of two smaller snarks, then both of them are irreducible. This result constitutes the first step towards the proof of the following "unique-factorisation" theorem: Every irreducible snark G can be factorised into a collection \{H1,.,Hn\} of cyclically 5 connected irreducible snarks such that G can be reconstructed from them by iterated dot products. Moreover, such a collection is unique up to isomorphism and ordering of the factors regardless of the way in which the decomposition was performed. The result is best possible in the sense that it fails for snarks that are close to being irreducible but themselves are not irreducible. Besides this theorem, a number of other results are proved. For example, the unique-factorisation theorem is extended to the case of factorisation with respect to a preassigned subgraph K which is required to stay intact during the whole factorisation process. We show that if K has order at least 3, then the theorem holds, but is false when K has order 2.},
