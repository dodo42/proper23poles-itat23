\section{Proper (2,3)-poles}\label{ch:proper-23-poles}



To explore multipoles effectively, it is best to start with the simplest ones and gradually move towards more complex ones. That's why we begin by examining the $k$-poles starting from the smallest $k$. Specifically, the smallest $k$ for which it is interesting to explore the colourability of $k$-poles arising from snarks with $k$-edge-cuts is 4.
The~1-poles are trivially uncolourable.
For a 2-pole to be colourable, both of its semiedges must have the same colour.
Similarly, for a 3-pole, all three of its semiedges must have pairwise different colours. Also, the colouring properties of $4$-poles are already widely explored since their colouring properties are limited as well \cite{ChladnyFactorisation}.
The analysis of the colouring properties of $5$-pole comes from the followning result of P. J. Cameron, A. G. Chetwynd and J. J. Watkins.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{Cameron1987}]
	Let $G$ be a snark with a $5$-edge-c-cut whose removal results in $5$-poles $M_1$ and $M_2$, and $G$ is not the Petersen graph. Then either
	\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
		\item one of $M_1$, $M_2$ is not 3-edge-colourable, or
		\item both can be extended to snarks by adding at most five vertices such that at least one of those extended graphs is smaller than $G$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We outline the main idea of the proof, since base our work on it. By the Parity Lemma, in each colouring $\phi$ of a $5$-pole $M$, three semiedges of $M$ have the same colour. We call these edges \textit{sociable} in $\phi$. The remaining two semiedges of $M$, called \emph{solitary} in $\phi$, are colourd by the remaining two colours.
Because the colouring set of $M$ is closed under a permutaion of colours, it only matters which semiedges of $M$ may be solitary. Using this, we can visualize the colouring set of any 5-pole in the following way.

%Since the colouring set of $M$ is closed under a permutaion of colours, we can decsribe $\text{col}(M)$ by specifying all pairs of semiedges of $M$ that are solitary in some colouring of $M$.

For a 5-pole $M(e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4,e_5)$ we denote by $R_M$ a graph with vertex set $V=\{e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4,e_5\}$, in which for each $e_i,e_j\in V$, the graph contains an edge $e_ie_j$ if and only if there exists a colouring $\phi$ of $M$ such that the semiedges $e_i$ and $e_j$ are solitary in $\phi$. $R_M$ is called the \textit{colouring graph of $M$}.
The colouring graph $R_M$ of any $5$-pole has no verex of degree one \cite{Preissmann1983}.

%There may seem to be many possible colourings of proper (2,3)-poles, as, in theory, each subset of C represents a different colouring set. However, we will show that not each of these subsets can be attained.

%Let $M$ be a multipole, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ colourings of $M$ such that $\phi_1$ uses $C=\{c_1,c_2,c_3\}$ as the set of colours and $\phi_2$ uses $D=\{d_1,d_2,d_3\}$. We say that $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are \textit{isomorphic} if there exists a bijection $f\colon C\rightarrow D$ and for each edge $e$ from $E(M)$ $\phi_2(e)=f(\phi_1(e))$.

%Let $M$ be any $5$-pole. First, we can see that because of colouring isomorphism, if one colouring can be attained, then the colouring set of $M$ must contain this colouring along with all possible isomorphic colourings to the first one. Also, we can get a new colouring using the interchange of colours on a chain.

%\begin{lemma}[\cite{Preissmann1983}]
%	Let $M$ be a 5-pole and $\phi$ a colouring of $M$. Let $p$ and $q$ be its two solitary semiedges in $\phi$. Then there exists a sociable semiedge $p'$ and another colouring of $M$, in which $p'$ and $q$ are solitary.
%	\label{lem:solitary}
%\end{lemma}
%
%The idea behind the proof is that if $p$ has colour 1 and $q$ colour 2, we take into account a subgraph of $M$ formed by the edges with colours 1 and 3. In this partial graph, there is a path, which is called a (Kempe) chain, in which the extremities are $p$~and a~sociable semiedge $p'$. By the interchange of colours 1 and 3 along this chain, we obtain a new colouring of $M$ in which $p'$ and $q$ are solitary.

%Let $T$ be a 5-pole and $\phi$ its colouring. Then let $p$ and $q$ be its two solitary semiedges in this colouring, $2$ the colour of $p$ and $3$ the colour of $q$. In the partial graph $T'$ formed by the edges of colours $1$ and $2$ there is a chain which extremities are $p$ and a sociable semiedge $p_1$. By the interchange of colours $1$ and $2$ along this chain. we obtain a new colouring of $T$ in which $p_1$ and $q$ are solitary.

From a case analysis, it follows that if both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are colourable, then for each $i \in \{1, 2\}$, the colouring graph $R_{M_i}$ of $M_i$ is a subgraph of:
\begin{itemize}
\item a $5$-cycle, or
\item the graph formed by two disjoint triangles sharing a single vertex, or
\item the complement of $C_3$.
\end{itemize}
Accordingly, $5$-poles whose colouring graphs are subgraphs of the mentioned graphs are called \textit{superpentagons}, \textit{negators} and \textit{proper $(2 ,3)$-poles}, respectively. Note that the introduced three clases of the $5$-poles are not disjoint.

The colouring graph of a superpentagon is either empty or the $5$-cycle. The colouring grah of a negator is empty, consists of one triangle or consists of two triangles with a common vertex.
%TODO: Zišlo by sa asi lepšie sformulovať.
Máčajová and Škoviera characterised which negators have which clolouring graphs \cite{IrreducibleSnarksSkoviera}.
For proper $(2,3)$-poles, the situation is more diverse and their colouring graphs have not been studied yet.

%Using this theorem and the Parity lemma, it can be proven that if we get two colourable $5$-poles by severing five edges in a given snark, they can be only one of three types: negators, superpentagons and proper $(2,3)$-poles. For the first two, their colouring properties are already explored, which is why we chose to explore the last type.

%Negator $Neg(G;u,v)$ is a 5-pole resulting from the removal of a path $uwv$ of length 2 from a snark $G$ ($w$ is a common neighbour of $u$ and $v$). By default, negators have three connectors: $I = (e_1,e_2)$ and $O = (e_3,e_4)$ the connectors consisting of the semiedges formerly incident with $u$ and $v$, respectively, and $R = (e_5)$ the connector containing the~remaining semiedge.

%Let $C_5 = C_5(e_0, \cdots , e_4)$ denote the 5-pole consisting of a 5-cycle having vertices $v0, \cdots , v_4$, arranged cyclically, with five semidges $e_0,\cdots,e_4$ attached to them correspondingly. Superpentagon is any 5-pole $M$ with $\text{Col}(M)\subseteq \text{Col}(C_5)$ \cite{MorphologyOfSmall}.

Using the definitions from the previous chapter, a $(2,3)$-pole is a proper multipole consisting of two connectors, one containing two semiedges and the second three. We can easily construct a snark from it by the~junction of the semiedges in the connector of size two and joining the semiedges from the connector of size three to a new vertex, creating an edge and a vertex, respectively. Since they are proper, the result is a snark because there is no Tait colouring, where the edges joined in the new vertex would have all different colours. Similarly, proper (2,3)-poles do not allow Tait colourings, in which the semiedges in the connector of size 2 have the same colour.

Thus if we take a cubic graph $G$, remove its vertex $v$ and sever its edge $ab$, which is not incident with $v$, and the result is a proper (2,3)-pole, then $G$ must be a snark. Now let us look at it the other way and prove that for each snark, the result after removing a vertex and severing an edge will always be a proper (2,3)-pole.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $G$ be a snark. Let $T(A,B)$ be a multipole $R(G;v;ab)$ where the edge $ab$ is not incident with $v$, such that $A$ contains the two semiedges resulting from severing $ab$ and connector $B$ contains the three semiedges resulting from removing $v$. Then $T(A,B)$ is a proper (2,3)-pole.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We prove that $T(A,B)$ is a proper (2,3)-pole. Suppose the contrary, so there is a colouring $\phi$, for which $\phi_*(A)=0$ or $\phi_*(B)=0$. Then by the Parity Lemma, the~flow through the second connector is also zero, so $\phi_*(A)=0, \phi_*(B)=0$. This allows extending the multipole by joining the semiedges in the connector $B$ and performing the junction of semiedges in the connector $A$, resulting in the original graph, which is colourable. This means that $G$ is not a snark, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

By default, when we get a proper (2,3)-pole in this way, we denote it by $T(A,B)$, where the connector $A$ contains the two semiedges resulting from severing the edge and similarly, connector $B$ contains the three semiedges resulting from removing the vertex, such that $A=(a_1,a_2)$ and $B=(b_1,b_2,b_3)$. An example can be seen in \cref{fig:23-pole-example}.

\end{figure*}

By applying the knowledge about the multipoles being proper and the Parity lemma, it is clear that the colouring set of each proper (2,3)-pole is a subset of

$$C=\{(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,b_3)\in\mathbb{K}^5~|~a_1+a_2=b_1+b_2+b_3\neq 0\}.$$

We will refer to this set only as $C$ from now on. Note that in this definition, the~terms $a_1$ to $b_3$ denote the colours of the respective semiedges. The non-equality to zero is evident because they are proper, and the equality of flow through both connectors follows from the Parity lemma.

Interesting types of proper (2,3)-poles are those whose colouring set is the same as $C$~defined above since they admit all possible colourings. We can define the term \textit{perfect} used to label these.

\begin{definition}
	A proper (2,3)-pole is called \textit{perfect} if its colouring set coincides with the colouring set $C$.
\end{definition}


Since the semiedges in proper (2,3)-poles are $(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,b_3)$, we can use them as the set of vertices in the colouring graphs of proper (2,3)-poles. These vertices can be seen in \cref{fig:proper-associated-vertices}.

\end{figure}

We will introduce a new notation to help explain how the colouring graph of a 5-pole looks. Let $M$ be a 5-pole. We say that $M$ \textit{allows solitary cycle} $e_1e_2\cdots e_n$ if for each $i$ from 1 to $n-1$, $M$ allows a colouring, where $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$ are solitary, including the colouring where $e_n$ and $e_1$ are solitary.
