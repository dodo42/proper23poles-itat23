\section{Proper (2,3)-poles}\label{ch:proper-23-poles}

Using the definitions from the previous chapter, it may be clear what the name proper (2,3)-pole means. It is a proper multipole consisting of two connectors, one containing two semiedges and the second three. We can easily construct a snark from it by the~junction of the semiedges in the connector of size two and joining the semiedges from the connector of size three to a new vertex, creating an edge and a vertex, respectively. Since they are proper, the result is a snark because there is no Tait colouring, where the edges joined in the new vertex would have all different colours. Similarly, proper (2,3)-poles do not allow Tait colourings, in which the semiedges in the connector of size 2 have the same colour.

Thus if we take a cubic graph $G$, remove its vertex $v$ and sever its edge $ab$, which is not incident with $v$, and the result is a proper (2,3)-pole, then $G$ must be a snark. Now let us look at it the other way and prove that for each snark, the result after removing a vertex and severing an edge will always be a proper (2,3)-pole.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $G$ be a snark. Let $T(A,B)$ be a multipole $R(G;v;ab)$ where the edge $ab$ is not incident with $v$, such that $A$ contains the two semiedges resulting from severing $ab$ and connector $B$ contains the three semiedges resulting from removing $v$. Then $T(A,B)$ is a proper (2,3)-pole.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We prove that $T(A,B)$ is a proper (2,3)-pole. Suppose the contrary, so there is a colouring $\phi$, for which $\phi_*(A)=0$ or $\phi_*(B)=0$. Then by the Parity Lemma, the~flow through the second connector is also zero, so $\phi_*(A)=0, \phi_*(B)=0$. This allows extending the multipole by joining the semiedges in the connector $B$ and performing the junction of semiedges in the connector $A$, resulting in the original graph, which is colourable. This means that $G$ is not a snark, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

By default, when we get a proper (2,3)-pole in this way, we denote it by $T(A,B)$, where the connector $A$ contains the two semiedges resulting from severing the edge and similarly, connector $B$ contains the three semiedges resulting from removing the vertex, such that $A=(a_1,a_2)$ and $B=(b_1,b_2,b_3)$. An example can be seen in \cref{fig:23-pole-example}.

To explore multipoles effectively, it is best to start with the simplest ones and gradually move towards more complex ones. That's why we begin by examining the $k$-poles starting from the smallest $k$. Specifically, the smallest $k$ for which it is interesting to explore the colourability of $k$-poles arising from snarks with $k$-edge-cuts is 4. The~1-poles are trivially uncolourable, while the colourability of 2-poles and 3-poles is limited due to the Parity Lemma. For a 2-pole to be colourable, both of its semiedges must have the same colour. Similarly, for a 3-pole, all three of its semiedges must have pairwise different colours. Also, the colouring properties of $4$-poles are already widely explored since their colouring properties are limited as well \cite{ChladnyFactorisation}. That is why we have moved to explore $5$-poles. The motivation to explore specifically the colouring properties of proper (2,3)-poles comes from the fact that proper (2,3)-poles are one of three types of interesting 5-poles resulting from snarks, based on their colouring properties. We can introduce a theorem from an article by P. J. Cameron, A. G. Chetwynd and J. J. Watkins, proving that this is true.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{Cameron1987}]
	Let $G$ be a snark with a $5$-edge-c-cut whose removal results in components $G_1$ and $G_2$, and $G$ is not the Petersen graph. Then either
	\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
		\item one of $G_1,G_2$ is not 3-edge-colourable, or
		\item both can be extended to snarks by adding at most five vertices such that at least one of those extended graphs is smaller than $G$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Using this theorem and the Parity lemma, it can be proven that if we get two colourable $5$-poles by severing five edges in a given snark, they can be only one of three types: negators, superpentagons and proper $(2,3)$-poles. For the first two, their colouring properties are already explored, which is why we chose to explore the last type.

Negator $Neg(G;u,v)$ is a 5-pole resulting from the removal of a path $uwv$ of length 2 from a snark $G$ ($w$ is a common neighbour of $u$ and $v$). By default, negators have three connectors: $I = (e_1,e_2)$ and $O = (e_3,e_4)$ the connectors consisting of the semiedges formerly incident with $u$ and $v$, respectively, and $R = (e_5)$ the connector containing the~remaining semiedge.

Let $C_5 = C_5(e_0, \cdots , e_4)$ denote the 5-pole consisting of a 5-cycle having vertices $v0, \cdots , v_4$, arranged cyclically, with five semidges $e_0,\cdots,e_4$ attached to them correspondingly. Superpentagon is any 5-pole $M$ with $\text{Col}(M)\subseteq \text{Col}(C_5)$ \cite{MorphologyOfSmall}.

By applying the knowledge about the multipoles being proper and the Parity lemma, it is clear that the colouring set of each proper (2,3)-pole is a subset of

$$C=\{(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,b_3)\in\mathbb{K}^5~|~a_1+a_2=b_1+b_2+b_3\neq 0\}.$$

We will refer to this set only as $C$ from now on. Note that in this definition, the~terms $a_1$ to $b_3$ denote the colours of the respective semiedges. The non-equality to zero is evident because they are proper, and the equality of flow through both connectors follows from the Parity lemma.

Interesting types of proper (2,3)-poles are those whose colouring set is the same as $C$~defined above since they admit all possible colourings. We can define the term \textit{perfect} used to label these.

\begin{definition}
	A proper (2,3)-pole is called \textit{perfect} if its colouring set coincides with the colouring set $C$.
\end{definition}

Another corollary of the Parity Lemma may be that for each 5-pole to be colourable, it needs to have three semiedges of one colour and the other two with a different colour each. This way, we can define so-called solitary and sociable semiedges.

\begin{definition}
	Let $M$ be a 5-pole and $\phi$ its colouring. The three semiedges coloured by the same colour are called \textit{sociable} in $\phi$, and the other two coloured by a colour different from the others are called \textit{solitary} in $\phi$.
\end{definition}

There may seem to be many possible colourings of proper (2,3)-poles, as, in theory, each subset of C represents a different colouring set. However, we will show that not each of these subsets can be attained.

Let $M$ be a multipole, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ colourings of $M$ such that $\phi_1$ uses $C=\{c_1,c_2,c_3\}$ as the set of colours and $\phi_2$ uses $D=\{d_1,d_2,d_3\}$. We say that $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are \textit{isomorphic} if there exists a bijection $f\colon C\rightarrow D$ and for each edge $e$ from $E(M)$ $\phi_2(e)=f(\phi_1(e))$.

Let $T$ be any proper (2,3)-pole. First, we can see that because of colouring isomorphism, if one colouring can be attained, then the colouring set of $T$ must contain this colouring along with all possible isomorphic colourings to the first one. Also, we can get a new colouring using the interchange of colours on a chain.

\begin{lemma}[\cite{Preissmann1983}]
	Let $T$ be a 5-pole and $\phi$ a colouring of $T$. Let $p$ and $q$ be its two solitary semiedges in $\phi$. Then there exists a sociable semiedge $p'$ and another colouring of $T$, in which $p'$ and $q$ are solitary.
	\label{lem:solitary}
\end{lemma}

The idea behind the proof is that if $p$ has colour 1 and $q$ colour 2, we take into account a subgraph of $T$ formed by the edges with colours 1 and 3. In this partial graph, there is a path, which is called a (Kempe) chain, in which the extremities are $p$~and a~sociable semiedge $p'$. By the interchange of colours 1 and 3 along this chain, we obtain a new colouring of $T$ in which $p'$ and $q$ are solitary.

%Let $T$ be a 5-pole and $\phi$ its colouring. Then let $p$ and $q$ be its two solitary semiedges in this colouring, $2$ the colour of $p$ and $3$ the colour of $q$. In the partial graph $T'$ formed by the edges of colours $1$ and $2$ there is a chain which extremities are $p$ and a sociable semiedge $p_1$. By the interchange of colours $1$ and $2$ along this chain. we obtain a new colouring of $T$ in which $p_1$ and $q$ are solitary.

Because of the isomorphism of colourings, it does not matter which colours we use in the colouring, but rather which semiedges are solitary. Using this, we can visualize the colouring set of any 5-pole in the following way.

For a 5-pole $T(e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4,e_5)$ we denote by $R_T$ a graph with vertex set\linebreak $V=\{e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4,e_5\}$, in which for each $e_i,e_j\in V$, the graph contains an edge $e_ie_j$ if and only if there exists a colouring $\phi$ of $T$ such that the semiedges $e_i$ and $e_j$ are solitary in $\phi$. $R_T$ is called a \textit{colouring graph of T}. By \cref{lem:solitary}, $R_T$ has no pendant vertex \cite{Preissmann1983}.

Since the semiedges in proper (2,3)-poles are $(a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,b_3)$, we can use them as the set of vertices in the colouring graphs of proper (2,3)-poles. These vertices can be seen in \cref{fig:proper-associated-vertices}.

\end{figure}

We will introduce a new notation to help explain how the colouring graph of a 5-pole looks. Let $T$ be a 5-pole. We say that $T$ \textit{allows solitary cycle} $e_1e_2\cdots e_n$ if for each $i$ from 1 to $n-1$, $T$ allows a colouring, where $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$ are solitary, including the colouring where $e_n$ and $e_1$ are solitary.
