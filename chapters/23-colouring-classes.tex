%\section{Colouring classes}
\label{sec:colouring-classes}

Now, we describe all possible colouring sets of proper (2,3)-poles on their colouring graphs. Since there is no rule on which semiedges are labelled $b_1,b_2,b_3$ after removing a vertex from a snark, we will divide the colouring sets into classes, in which the colouring sets represent colourings up to a permutation of colours and a permutation of labels $b_1,b_2,b_3$.

However, not each graph on these vertices represents a possible colouring set. First, the graph must have no pendant vertex, as mentioned above. The second restriction is that no edge is between two vertices from $\{b_1,b_2,b_3\}$. Suppose there was an edge between $b_1$ and $b_2$ in some proper (2,3)-pole $T$. This would mean that $T$ allows a colouring such that $b_1,b_2$ and $b_3$ have pairwise different colours and $a_1,a_2$ have the same colour. Thus $T$ could be extended to the former graph, which would be colourable and therefore not a snark, which contradicts the assumption.

This means there are only $12$ different colouring sets of proper (2,3)-poles, which can be divided into classes in the following way. We denote the classes by a number representing how many vertices from $\{b_1,b_2,b_3\}$ are connected to $\{a_1,a_2\}$ with an edge in the colouring graph, followed by A if the colouring allows an edge between $a_1$ and $a_2$, or B otherwise. Resulting are six colouring classes: 0B (uncolourable), 1A, 2B, 2A, 3B and 3A. Proper (2,3)-poles from Class 3A, that is those whose colouring set coincides with $C$, are also called \textit{perfect}. For each of them we have found an example, in this article we provide an example of an uncolourable proper (2,3)-pole in \cref{fig:uncolourable-example} resulting from the second Blanu≈°a snark and a perfect one in \cref{fig:perfect-example} resulting from the Petersen graph.

The colouring graphs for Class 1A can be observed in \cref{fig:class-1A} as an illustrative example.
