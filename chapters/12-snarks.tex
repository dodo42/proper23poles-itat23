\section{Snarks}\label{sec:snarks}

As mentioned in Introduction, the study of the problem of 3-edge-colourability of cubic graphs is important since they are minimal possible counterexamples to several open problems.

%An \textit{edge-colouring} of a graph is a mapping $\phi$ from the set $E$ of edges of the graph to some non-empty set of colours $C$ such that every two adjacent edges have assigned different elements from $C$. Subsequently, a graph is \textit{n-edge-colourable} if and only if there exists an edge-colouring of the graph, where the set of colours has precisely $n$~elements.

%Graph $G$ is called \textit{k-connected} if $|G|>k$ and $R(G;X;\emptyset)$ is connected for every set $X\subseteq V, ~|X|<k$ \cite{Diestel2010}.

\begin{definition}\label{def:snark}
	\textit{Snark} is a 2-connected cubic graph which is not 3-edge-colourable.
\end{definition}

From now on, if we say that a graph or a multipole is colourable, we mean that there exists a 3-edge-colouring for that given construction.

Let $G$ be a cubic graph and $S$ an edge-cut of size $n$. By severing the edges of $S$, we obtain two $n$-poles such that $G$ is a junction of them. If both contain a cycle, $S$ is said to be an \textit{n-edge-c-cut}. Generally, these edge cuts are called \textit{c-cuts}. 

A cubic graph $G$ is called \textit{cyclically n-edge-connected} if there is no c-cut with less than $n$ edges.

\begin{definition}
	Let $G$ be a cubic graph with at least one c-cut. \textit{Cyclic edge connectivity} of $G$ is the smallest number of edges of a c-cut of $G$ and is denoted by $z(G)$.
\end{definition}

Another attribute of graphs that shall be defined is the \textit{girth} of a graph $G$, which is the minimum length of a cycle in $G$. If $G$ does not contain a cycle, we set the girth to $\infty$.

Many authors include in their definition of snarks additional criteria of \quotes{non-triviality}, for example, girth at least five or being cyclically-edge-4-connected \cite{Preissmann1983, Nedela1996}. On the other hand, some authors allow snarks to contain bridges \cite{IrreducibleSnarksSkoviera}, making the dumbbell graph on two vertices the smallest snark (\cref{fig:dumbbell}).

The Petersen graph is the smallest snark satisfying every definition (\cref{fig:petersen}). Other notable snarks are the BlanuÅ¡a snarks, or the infinite family of flower snarks discovered by R. Isaacs \cite{Isaacs1975}. The Isaacs snarks are denoted by $J_k$, where $k$ is an odd integer $k\geq 3$.
